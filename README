This is a video game which I am developing. The premise is that the player has seven days to explore a world and they have many places
to go. At each place, different events can occur, and also random events may occur. This means that it is unlikely for a player
to have the same experience on each play through. It features an RPG battle system, a skill point leveling system, recruitable
enemy characters, and intense dialogues which determine outcomes and can dynamically affect the game.

It is still early in development, therefore there are many bugs and not a lot of content yet!

I plan on releasing for free at some point for as many platforms as possible!
